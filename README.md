# WinXcorners

version 1.0

## Requirements

    Windows 10 x86/x64

Notice: This version doesn't support multiple monitors

WinXcorners allows you to assign events to trigger on your main monitor corners, it activates when your mouse cursor hovers them, i.e. when you move your mouse cursor to your screen edges.

These are the options that you can select:

    Show all windows, using Task view, the new Windows 10 feature.
    Show desktop
    Start Screen Saver, and
    Turn off monitors

And when you are going to play video games, it includes a toggle option that will disable it temporarily.

The application runs in the System Tray, by right clicking you can enable it to run when Windows starts (logon).

Limitations:

    The application won't detect the screen edges if you are using (focused) an elevated privileged application. But you can always restart the application as administrator.
    If you have multiple monitors, it won't work in a secondary monitor.
